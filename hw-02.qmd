### Intepretation

The `ridgeline` plot above visualizes the distribution of Airbnb review scores across different Edinburgh neighborhoods, ordered by their respective median review scores. The neighborhoods with the highest overall reviews appear at the top of the plot with a descending order down the plot to the neighborhoods with the lowest review scores. Most review scores cluster tightly between 90 and 100 (x-axis), suggesting generally positive experiences overall in the set of reviews. However, some neighborhoods display broader distributions or lower medians. A broader distribution indicates that the reviews have a larger spread along the review spectrum.
